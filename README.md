step 1: 
What I Built with using AI ?
- Built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Created index.html, style.css, and script.js

Step 2: 
Git Setup
- Initialized Git repository
- Added all files to Git
- Committed changes
- Pushed to GitHub

step 3:
GitHub Pages Deployment
- Went to repository Settings
- Clicked on "Pages" in the left sidebar
- Selected Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- Selected Branch: "main" and folder: "/ (root)"
- Clicked Save
- Waited 3-4 minutes for deployment

Step 4: 
Troubleshooting
- Initially got 404 error
- Problem: Files were in a subfolder instead of root directory
- Solution: Moved all files to root folder
- Re-pushed to GitHub
- Website went live successfully
